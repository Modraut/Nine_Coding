# Nine Coding Challenge

## Things to do

1. initialize project, install libraries and make server running. 
2. enable CORS
3. return expected response
4. add testing with Jest
5. deploy the app with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and connect it to my domain
6. test if CORS is enabled


## Assumptions
* As per sample request and response, the JSON data is valid as long as there is more than one match in the payload
* We don't need to add validation for the attributes of the objects in the payload
* The three fields that we need to return will never be null/undefined



## Improvements
* add validation if necessary. express-validator can be useful
* swagger-ui-express to provide UI showing the details of APIs
